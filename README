# This assumes you've already launched the puppy.dev server
# and added its host entry to your local /etc/hosts file.

# Copy over the index.html file

local> scp index.html root@puppy.dev:

# Set up the html and image files on puppy.dev

local> ssh root@puppy.dev 'bash -s -e' < 1-puppy-set-up-files.sh

# Run Docker on puppy.dev

local> ssh root@puppy.dev 'bash -s -e' < 2-puppy-run-docker.sh

# If all was successful, then you should be able verify the site:

http://puppy.dev

(Remember, that URL will only work if you set up the IP-to-Host mapping in your local /etc/hosts correctly)
